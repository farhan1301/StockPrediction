# StockPrediction
A stock prediction model with a custom dataset created from 'Alpha Vantage API' by aligning two APIs - Market News & Sentiment and Core Stock API.

This custom dataset is used to train an LSTM model optimized using LSTM attention.

The model is evaluated using RMSE (Root mean square error).

Currently, it's only tested on IBM stock data.
